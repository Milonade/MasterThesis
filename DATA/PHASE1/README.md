## Interview with A. 32 (f)

- Her style is inspired first by 50s-60s music.
- Her motivations for shopping secondhand come from her parents.
- Uses mainly Vinted since 2021.
- Buys music, artists' merch, clothes, and accessories.
- Does not buy often but uses it as virtual window shopping.
- Comes back to the app in hopes of finding luxury items at low prices.
- But is scared of scams on Vinted and would rather buy luxury items on Vestiaire Collective.
- Thinks that we are at a time where everything is accessible, so people want to differentiate themselves even more…
- Europeans use Vinted as a cheaper postal service to send object to themselves or to their friend (not very ecological)

Even though the trend appears more in designers collections, '90s fashion' seems to be stable among internet searches compared to the same period last year.

# Apprehensions

I am afraid that reflecting on my own experience may be too sensitive or personal and therefore fall outside the academic context. Additionally, my biased perspective might not provide interesting and relevant insights on this topic.
